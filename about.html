Hi!  My name's Bennet Huber, and I've decided to start a blog.  We'll see where it goes, most likely nowhere.  I do have several things I want to write about though, so hopefully I'll have time to do so.  It will probably be mostly technical/programming stuff, with a smattering of other things I'm thinking about.
</p>

<p>
A little bit about me.  I was born in 1987, and grew up in Lower Merion, right outside Philadelpha.  I got a degree in Computer Science from The Pennsylvania State University in 2010, with a minor in Mathematics.  Since then, I've been doing software development professionally full time.  First at Azavea in Philadelpha from 2010 - 2014, then Amazon from 2014 - 2021 in Seattle (for <em>exactly</em> seven years), then finally Compose.AI from 2021 - November, 2022.  My second child was born in December, 2022, so since then I've been mostly playing house husband.
</p>

<p>
I have a wide variety of interests that I may or may not write about on this blog.  In addition to software development, I'm interested in economics, political systems, DIY/hacking, and complex systems in general.
